### Git Rm
The `git rm` command is used to remove files from the staging area and the working directory.
**Example**
```
git rm --cached<file>
Ex: git rm --cached file1.txt
```

### Git Stash
The `git stash` command is used to temporarily store all the modified tracked files and staged changes.
**Example**
```
git stash -m "name"
Ex: git stash -m "Work in progress"
```
**Description :** 

```
- git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working directory so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
- The stashed changes are saved onto a stack, from which they can be re-applied (or dropped) later.
Commonly used options include:
- git stash pop: Re-applies the stashed changes and removes them from the stash stack.
- git stash apply: Re-applies the stashed changes without removing them from the stash stack.
- git stash list: Lists all stashed changesets.
- git stash drop: Removes a single stashed state from the stash list.
- git stash clear: Removes all the stashed states.
```
